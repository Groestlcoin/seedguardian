##what-is-it
This software shares your BIP39 12 words seed in 15 words shares.
If you share your seed in 3 shares with a threshold of 2, you need 2 shares to reconstruct your seed, so you could lose one share, and somebody finding one share can't reconstruct your seed.

##Libraries
This software is built using following libraries
 - angular.js
 - bootstrap.css
 - secrets.js
 - bip39.js
